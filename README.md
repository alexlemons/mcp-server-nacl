### Model Context Protocol

The [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) is an open protocol that aims to standardize how we connect AI models to different data sources and tools.

By creating a universal standard, connecting to AI systems becomes simple and reliable. 
Fragmented integrations can be replaced with a single protocol.

The basic architecture:  
- MCP servers expose data/tools  
- MCP clients are AI applications that connect to MCP servers to consume data/tools.
